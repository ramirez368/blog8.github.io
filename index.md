# Quantum Computing
Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications in banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.

SQuantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk, Honeywell, Microsoft, AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of Quantum Computing. The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass $2.5 billion by 2029. And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability, information theory, and machine learning.

## Why Two Tech Giants Are Arguing About Quantum Computers:
## Is it a Google or IBM credit?
![Why Two Tech Giants Are Arguing About Quantum Computers](https://media.wired.com/photos/5e333e15be05400008f39506/1:1/w_1500,c_limit/Business-QuantumComputing-Google-L1001386.jpg)


The tech giant announced that it had reached a long-anticipated milestone known as “quantum supremacy”—a watershed moment in which a quantum computer executes a calculation that no ordinary computer can match. In a new paper in Nature, Google described just such a feat performed on its state-of-the-art quantum machine, code-named “Sycamore.” Although quantum computers are not yet at a point where they can do useful things, this result demonstrates that they have an inherent advantage over ordinary computers for some tasks.


Yet in an 11th-hour objection, Google’s chief quantum-computing rival asserted that the quantum-supremacy threshold has not yet been crossed. In a paper posted online Monday, IBM provided evidence that the world’s most powerful supercomputer can nearly keep pace with Google’s new quantum machine. As a result, IBM argued that Google’s claim should be received “with a large dose of skepticism.”

Why all the confusion? Aren’t major milestones supposed to be big, unambiguous achievements? The episode reminds us that not all scientific revolutions arrive as a thunderclap—and that quantum supremacy in particular involves more nuance than fits in a headline.

Quantum computers have been under development for decades. While ordinary, or classical, computers perform calculations using sequences of bits composed of 1s and 0s, quantum computers encode information using quantum bits, or qubits, that behave according to the strange rules of quantum mechanics. Quantum computers aim to harness those features to rapidly perform calculations far beyond the capacity of any ordinary computer. But for years, quantum computers struggled to match the computing power of a handheld calculator.

In 2012, John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, coined the phrase quantum supremacy to describe the moment when a quantum computer finally surpasses even the best supercomputer. The term caught on, but experts came to hold different ideas about what it means
