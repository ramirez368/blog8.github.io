# What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

The tech giant announced that it had reached a long-anticipated milestone known as “quantum supremacy”—a watershed moment in which a quantum computer executes a calculation that no ordinary computer can match. In a new paper in Nature, Google described just such a feat performed on its state-of-the-art quantum machine, code-named “Sycamore.” Although quantum computers are not yet at a point where they can do useful things, this result demonstrates that they have an inherent advantage over ordinary computers for some tasks.


Yet in an 11th-hour objection, Google’s chief quantum-computing rival asserted that the quantum-supremacy threshold has not yet been crossed. In a paper posted online Monday, IBM provided evidence that the world’s most powerful supercomputer can nearly keep pace with Google’s new quantum machine. As a result, IBM argued that Google’s claim should be received “with a large dose of skepticism.”

Why all the confusion? Aren’t major milestones supposed to be big, unambiguous achievements? The episode reminds us that not all scientific revolutions arrive as a thunderclap—and that quantum supremacy in particular involves more nuance than fits in a headline.

Quantum computers have been under development for decades. While ordinary, or classical, computers perform calculations using sequences of bits composed of 1s and 0s, quantum computers encode information using quantum bits, or qubits, that behave according to the strange rules of quantum mechanics. Quantum computers aim to harness those features to rapidly perform calculations far beyond the capacity of any ordinary computer. But for years, quantum computers struggled to match the computing power of a handheld calculator.

In 2012, John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, coined the phrase quantum supremacy to describe the moment when a quantum computer finally surpasses even the best supercomputer. The term caught on, but experts came to hold different ideas about what it means
